**Project Description**

This project is focused on implementing lane-following capabilities for autonomous vehicles in the Gym Donkey Car simulation environment. The system employs a combination of OpenCV for image processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for steering angle prediction. The workflow involves reading data from the Gym Donkey Car simulation, applying image transformations, and utilizing computer vision techniques to extract lane information. And using these lane information , the car is steered in the track and the dataset is collected for further training in Deep Learning.
